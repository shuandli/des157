	<h1>2/13/17....</h1>
	<p>Similar to my Studio 3, Studio 4 adopts a white background with a simple font
	for easy reading, which is the first example of an easy-to-understand user interface.
	A clear hierarchy comes second, established with a large title dwarfing the smaller texts.
	Because text is arranged vertically, viewers immediately understand that they need to scroll down.
	Text is used sparingly with brigth visuals to keep people interested. Visually, the whole page
	can breathe.</p>

	<h1>2/7/17....</h1>
	<p>My Studio 3 most noticably connects to UI design through its top-down interaction.
	In other, words, the interaction is meant to start from the top and end up at the bottom,
	starting at selecting the hat and working down towards the sketchbook. The eye has an
	easy path to follow. Visually, images and text are given enough weight and distance to breath,
	with quick and easy paragraphs with not too much text. It is easy to follow once again.</p>

	<h1>1/31/17....</h1>
	<p>National Geographic's hierarchy is apparent with the sizes and arrangements
	of its homepage photos. Each main photo covers the width of the page immediately
	drawing attention and is followed by two smaller photos below. They all have
	captions that are easy to read but small enough to not compete with the photos.
	Text is clear, giving it clarity and it repeats its visual hierarchy throughout.
	National Geographic's homepage is overall very easy to follow.

	<h1>1/12/17....</h1>
	<p>Facebook, a website I visit all too much. The fact that I find it easy to use
	means I am either very used to it or it is that easy to use. Breaking it down, there
	is quite a bit of intuitive design. The two center columns showing the newsfeed and
	news/ad space are the largest, so it's what my eyes go to first, as users would want
	to immediately read what's going on. The chat bar and group information off to
	either side are easily distinguishable with multiple icons and colors with the
	search bar up top like on a typical browser window. Facebook's homepage is overall
	sectioned off and easy to navigate.</p>
