	<h3>blog day 1....</h3>
	<p>Facebook, a website I visit all too much. The fact that I find it easy to use
	means I am either very used to it or it is that easy to use. Breaking it down, there
	is quite a bit of intuitive design. The two center columns showing the newsfeed and
	news/ad space are the largest, so it's what my eyes go to first, as users would want
	to immediately read what's going on. The chat bar and group information off to
	either side are easily distinguishable with multiple icons and colors with the
	search bar up top like on a typical browser window. Facebook's homepage is overall
	sectioned off and easy to navigate.</p>
