	<h3>2/7/16....</h3>
	<p>My Studio 3 most noticably connects to UI design through its top-down interaction.
	In other, words, the interaction is meant to start from the top and end up at the bottom,
	starting at selecting the hat and working down towards the sketchbook. The eye has an
	easy path to follow. Visually, images and text are given enough weight and distance to breath,
	with quick and easy paragraphs with not too much text. It is easy to follow once again.</p>

	<h3>blog day 2....</h3>
	<p>The photos that cover the homepage of National Geographic is enough to make
	it interesting, at least from a visual standpoint. From a user perspective,
	navigation is a breeze. All it takes is scrolling down to go through sections
	on magazine, television, and photography. As a bonus, the photos on the
	home page are headlined with a photo that holds the viewer's attention.</p>

	<h3>blog day 1....</h3>
	<p>Facebook, a website I visit all too much. The fact that I find it easy to use
	means I am either very used to it or it is that easy to use. Breaking it down, there
	is quite a bit of intuitive design. The two center columns showing the newsfeed and
	news/ad space are the largest, so it's what my eyes go to first, as users would want
	to immediately read what's going on. The chat bar and group information off to
	either side are easily distinguishable with multiple icons and colors with the
	search bar up top like on a typical browser window. Facebook's homepage is overall
	sectioned off and easy to navigate.</p>
