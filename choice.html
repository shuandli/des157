			<li>My topic for the project is global warming and how to address it through
			sustainable living i.e. looking for sustainable alternatives to things that
			otherwise contribute to global warming. I am thinking of putting together
			an interactive virtual tour style interface where people can go through
			rooms of a hosue (or apartment) and select items. Selected items will display
			messages that propose sustainable alternatives. For example, clicking on a
			lamp could show a fluorescent lightbulb instead of an incondescent one.</li>
