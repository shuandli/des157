		<h3>Power Shift Network</h3>
		<p>An offshoot of the Energy Action Coalition, Power Shift Network is more
    than anything an activist group focused on achieving economic equality through
    a greener environment. In other words, they believe they can provide jobs
    by increasing the amount of green activity in the US. Power Shift's actions
    within the last year include but are not limited to protesting at Standing
    Rock and attempting to launch "it.eco" as a platform for environmental groups
    to congregate.</p>

		<h3>Unesco: Green Citizens</h3>
		<p>The Unesco: Green Citizens is an exhibition intended to raise awareness
		on sustainable living and development for the sake of a cleaner planet in the
		future. They define sustainability as "meet the needs of the present without
		compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," and
		their exhibitions are located across the world. Users are able to submit their
		own stories about education in sustainability and they include projects ranging
		from sustainable rice farming to elementary school education in a green planet.
