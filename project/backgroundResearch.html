      <header>Article 1:"12 Ways to Live More Sustainably"</header>
      <p>"12 Ways to Live More Sustainably" covers methods of going green, including
      but not limited to reducing waste and driving less. These are not just general
      suggestions, however. The article provides information on very specific names for
      companies that do practice sustainable living for a more tangible way of educating
      people in living. One notable example is that when buying food, it gives detailed
      instructions on what to look for in an USDA organic label. The whole list is in summary
      1.shop wisely 2.fuel efficient vehicles 3.reduce plastic 4.boycott damaging products
      5.watch for USDA Organic label 6.conserve water 7.drive less 8.fluorescent lights
      9.solar power 10.eat less meat (ouch!) 11.have a smaller family 12.vote.
      Given my project's goal of suggesting sustainable alternatives to things that might hurt
      the environment, this article could come in handy for what exact alternatives could be used.
      For example, the article's seventh items is to drive less and opt for biking,
      walking, and public transportation. Perhaps that could take the form of an
      interactive bike in my project.</p>

      <header>Article 2:"Global Warming, Climate Change and Sustainability"</header>
      <p>"Global Warming, Climate Change and Sustainability" interestingly enough
      tackles the necessity of sustainable living from a Christian perspective,
      that taking care of the enivorment and loving others is how we show our love
      for Jesus. That said, the article goes on to confirm that climate change is indeed
      happening, and that it is a product of unsustainable human activity. Unsustainable
      living contributes to the greenhouse effect, and climates are becoming more extreme,
      with water not being able to be taken for granted anymore. On a positive note,
      the article does discuss actions taken by other countries in addressing global
      warming, such as energy efficiency and the halting of deforestation.</p>

      <header>Article 3:"Sustainable Development Goals"</header>
      <p>The UN provides a list of 17 goals of sustainable living and how to achieve them.
      Each item goes into extensive detail on statistics such as poverty and gender equality,
      following with goals in certain time frames, followed further with links on organizations
      that are taking action. To list every item would fill several pages of research, but
      there is not denying that it allows for numerous possbilities of explaining why sustainable
      living matters in the first place.</p>
