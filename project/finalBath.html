					<p>You have heard it said that conservation is key to saving water.
					That of course includes showers. Try and limit your showers to no more than 15 minutes,
					and what you can even try to do is keep a bucket in your bath tub. Use the bucket to
					collect excess water that flows from your bath tub's faucet when you shower and to collect
					water as you wait for your shower to heat up. Then you will have water to water your lawn
					or garden if you have one!</p>

					<p>You have also heard it said that plastic is harmful for the environment, and cutting
					down on plastic usage can take place in the shower. Avoid hygiene products that use micro beads,
					as the beads are plastic and can flow into the drain into wherever the water goes.</p>

					<p>Just saying the word toilet is completely silly, but you may have seen toilets that have the two
						flushing options. In case you have not seen them, many public toilets have one button that flushes less and the other button flushes more, so you don't have to use so much water every time you take a dump. Consider upgrading to a toilet that has the two buttons to save water, though definitely ask your parents about upgrading toilets first since it's an expensive process.</p>
