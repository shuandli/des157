					<p>If you sleep on a memory foam mattress and think it smells weird, then it may be that foam mattress' chemicals at work. While comfortable, memory foam is not a very environmentally friendly or sustainable option for mattresses, made with toxic chemicals that include flame retardants to things you could barely pronounce. The toxic chemicals that go into making memory foam get released into the atmosphere during manufacturing along with numerous fossil fuels. Opt for cotton mattresses in your bedroom that are just as comfortable and take far fewer chemicals and fuels to make.</p>

					<p>There is nothing necessarily bad for the environment in a heater. However, ditching the heater for something like a sweater or blanket in the winter months will use that much less electricity and save power and money.</p>

					<p>You may have heard it said that fluorescent lightbulbs are the go-to sustainble alternative for incandescent lights. Even better than fluorescent lightbulbs, however, are LED lights. Where the incandescent lightbulb can only last for 1,200 hours at 60 Watts (or unit of power) and the fluorescent for 8,000 hours at 15 Watts, the LED goes for a whopping 50,000 hours at around 18 Watts. This of course means that buying LEDs can save money on electricity and use less energy for more sustainable living. As a bonus, LED lights themselves are not expensive, going for a similar price with your average lightbulb.</p>

					<p>This may sound like a no-brainer, but one way to go the extra mile in sustainable living is to simply use the sun to keep your room lit. Keep your window open and let the sun do the work.</p>
