					<p>Water is used just about everywhere, and that fact applies to the food we eat. Plants of course need to be watered and animals need to drink up. You may, however, be surprised at just how much water it takes to raise animals for meat. This includes giving animals drinks, growing crops for them to eat, and processing the meat. Beef takes the most water at around 1847 gallons to produce just one pound, while leaner meats like chicken takes 518 gallons. Most vegetables require well below 100 gallons to produce. Does this mean you who like meat should never eat it again to save water? Of course not! There is nothing wrong with enjoying the occasional burger or steak, but it helps the to stick mostly to lean meats and vegetables for a healthy planet and healthy diet.</p>

					<p>You probably sit on a wood chair when you eat at home. You probably sit on a plastic chair at school. Ideally, you should stick to wooden chairs. You may have already seen or read in this sustainable house that plastic products are not that friendly for the environment, as they are not generally biodegradeable and can be ingested animals. Wooden chairs are much easier to make, as it costs less and requires less energy to make a wood chair versus a plastic one. If you want to go the extra mile, look for bamboo chairs, as bamboo is extremely durable and the bamboo plant consumes very little water.</p>
