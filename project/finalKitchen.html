					<p>There will always be excess water that will drip from the dishes you wash. Don't let that water go to waste!Try installing a barred rack that holds plants below it. This way, the water that drips from your just-washed dishes does not have to make a mess on your drying rack.</p>

					<p>It may come as a surprise to you that handwashing dishes can actually consume more water than a dishwasher. This happens when you have a large, family-sized pile of dishes you have to clean. Only use the sink when you only have one or two people's worth of dishes.</p>

					<p>Handwashing your dishes all the time may sound like it uses less water, but when tackling tons of dishes, this is not the case. Use the dishwasher for large quantities of dishes, such as when your whole family is finished eating and you are all cleaning up for the night. Save the sink only for when you are washing just a plate or two.</p>

					<p>Sustainable living in the kitchen includes conservation, and that means having hosuehold items that will last longer than usual. When buying storage containers for your leftovers, get glass tupperwares. Glass will last far longer than plastic, and is a more sustainable resource.</p>

					<p>Chances are you play sports or are always on the go, but a good tip for conserving the amount of stuff you buy is to get a refillable water bottle when you are in your activities. Having a refillable water bottle will mean buying fewer resources, and don't worry about running out of water. If you are are at school, chances are you are never far from a water fountain to get a refill.</p>
