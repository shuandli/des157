					<p>As the house heats up in the summer, our first instinct is to crank up the air conditioning. While AC goes a long way into feeling comfortable, but it comes at a price. Two thirds of all American households have air conditioners which uses tons of power and emits literally hundreds of metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. You may hear carbon dioxide a lot when talking about climate change and global warming. Fans like the ones you clicked take up far less electricty to run at only a few tens of watts and will be friendlier to the planet and your family's electric bill.</p>

					<p>There is nothing wrong with relaxing and watching TV from time to time. But there are also plenty of TVs on the market that will use less electricity and save money and help the environment. The next time your family goes out to buy a TV, look for energy Star products to enjoy your favorite movie or show on.</p>

					<p>Add plants to your living room. Not only will plants add visual flare to your place but they will breathe in any carbon dioxide floating around your living room and convert it to oxygen. Think of it as getting free air!</p>
