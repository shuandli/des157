  <h1>The process</h1>

  <h2>The ideas</h2>
   <img src="images/processIdeas.jpg" alt="ideas">
   <p>I was initially deciding between basing project on global warming and portrayal of Asians in media. Sticking with the global warming idea, it evolved to encompass sustainable living to fit with Davis' "Davisness." As for the idea of going through a house, I am not entirely sure where that came from.

  <h2>The storyboards</h2>
    <img src="images/processBoards.jpg" alt="boards">
    <p>I decided to make my audience sixth to seventh grade children (when the ideas of sustainability were first introduced to me in classes), but the first storyboard placed the project in a science museum. Then I realized that there are not a whole lot of science museums, so I made the project a class tool to be able to cater to wider audiences.

  <h2>The prototypes</h2>

    <p>On paper, the prototype drawings and tests were not easy indicating what objects were interactive. When I go to coding, I was able to address this difficulty with css animations. Surprisingly, however, I found myself keeping track of my navigation the most when coding. I had numerous pages, to I made sure to know where pages were linking to.
    </p>

  <h2>The tests</h2>
    <img src="images/processTests.jpg" alt="tests">
    <p>The consensus of the audience tests: the good: art style, neat presentation, and the animations made the interactive items easy to distinguish. the things to fine tune: needed more items per page to interact with.
