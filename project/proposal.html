      <li>5.	The project, titled, “The Sustainable House,” takes on the form of a virtual tour. Users will start at a front door and work their way across several rooms including but not limited to a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Objects such as light bulbs and faucets can be selected where users will receive information on data such as how much energy the object consumes and the tour will suggest a sustainable alternative. Each room will be a web page that links from one to another, beginning with an index that describes the tour. User have the option to retake the tour upon completion.</li>
      <li>6.  “The Sustainable House” fits into ISEA’s theme of bio creation and data. The project visualizes data as facts and information through interacting with objects to keep users interested and learning topics on sustainability and the environment.</li>
      <li>7.	Andrew Li is a Graphic Design major at University of California, Davis. Ever since learning about global warming in grade school, Climate change has always been on his mind. He sees this project as an opportunity to share what sustainable living means to him and how small steps in everyday living can contribute to a greener planet. When Andrew is not coding, he enjoys drawing comic book superheroes and watching animated movies, and he hopes to get to work on one in the future.</li>
