      <li>1.	Working title for this project is “The Sustainable House.” </li>
      <li>2.	Duration is a full day.</li>
      <li>3.  The organizer, coder, and presenter of this project is Andrew Li, who has no particular affiliations.</li>
      <li>4.	The project is an interactive virtual tour through a house.
          Users will come across objects like light bulbs and sinks and will
          receive suggestions on sustainable alternatives if they click on them.</li>
      <li>5.	The project, titled, “The Sustainable House,” takes on the form of a virtual tour. Users will start at a front door and work their way across several rooms including but not limited to a kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. It is no specific house, rather a place with common household items. Objects such as light bulbs and faucets can be selected where users will receive information on data such as how much energy the object consumes and the tour will suggest a sustainable alternative. Each room will be a web page that links from one to another, beginning with an index that describes the tour. User has the option to retake the tour upon completion.</li>
      <li>6.  Promote on school websites as an educational tool, as an activity to learn more about sustainability.</li>
      <li>7.	The project will be found under the link https://shuandli.github.io/des157/project/final</li>
      <li>8.  No physical materials will be required, as this project will exist as a website that can be accessed on home or mobile devices. Once the website is accessed, users can come and go as they wish.</li>
      <li>9.  Andrew Li is a Graphic Design major at University of California, Davis. Ever since learning about global warming in grade school, Climate change has always been on his mind. He sees this project as an opportunity to share what sustainable living means to him and how small steps in everyday living can contribute to a greener planet. When Andrew is not coding, he enjoys drawing comic book superheroes and watching animated movies, and he hopes to get to work on one in the future.</li>
