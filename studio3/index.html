				<p>The panda hat I currently own is actually the third one I made.
				I do not recall where my first hat is, probably in my room somewhere at home home.
				It was not flat-brimmed, and ball caps tend to shrink my head. My brother
				has my second panda hat. The hat is a blank white cap with sharpie.
				I have not idea where the idea to draw on a hat came from, just though it
				would be a fun idea.</p>

				<p>I love my glasses, but they keep sliding towards the bottom of my nose.
				I need to keep looking forward or keep my eyes wide open for them to stay in place.
				It is honestly not a big deal, provided it doesn't rain. When it rains, it's game over.</p>

				<p>As if my portal wasn't an indication, I love Star Wars. Naturally I own a lightsaber.
				A collector's edition metal lightsaber that lights up and makes noises. It's silly, I know,
				but there's an undeniably great feeling just swinging a lightsaber around in a dark room.
				As a bonus, I have a new pick up line, "Hey girl. Wanna see my lightsaber collection?"</p>

			<aside id="watchInfo">
				<p>Long story long, I had a coworker who wore a wooden watch and I though it would be cool
				to have one and I treated myself on my birthday. There are no numbers, so people ask me if I
				can actually tell the time, though honestly it's not much harder than looking at the relative
				positions of the hands and ballparking the time.</p>
